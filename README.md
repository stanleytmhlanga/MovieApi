# MovieApi


As the test was sent to me to create web api, i have did my best in following good design pattern which include the follow.

1. Used Onion architecture
2. Repository pattern.
3. Dependancy injection using Ninject
4. The Third party Api for searching Movies.
5. Used Caching
6. used the async and await kew words for the web Api perfomance.


so the web Aip that created have two methods which is SearchMovieById and SearchMoviesByTitle and the Api is documented using Swagger.

runing the application id will direct you to swagger ui where you will see the two methods for seaching by default the url that you will see the application is like https://localhost:44398/swagger/ui/index.

then after that you can see how the web API works the request and the response of the caled methods.
